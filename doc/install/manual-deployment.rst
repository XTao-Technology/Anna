 Manual Deployment
===================

All Ceph clusters require at least one monitor, and at least as many OSDs as
copies of an object stored on the cluster.  Bootstrapping the initial monitor(s)
is the first step in deploying a Ceph Storage Cluster. Monitor deployment also
sets important criteria for the entire cluster, such as the number of replicas
for pools, the number of placement groups per OSD, the heartbeat intervals,
whether authentication is required, etc. Most of these values are set by
default, so it's useful to know about them when setting up your cluster for
production.

Following the same configuration as `Installation (Quick)`_, we will set up a
cluster with ``node1`` as  the monitor node, and ``node2`` and ``node3`` for 
OSD nodes.

Monitor Bootstrapping
=====================

Bootstrapping a monitor (a Ceph Storage Cluster, in theory) requires
a number of things:

- **Unique Identifier:** The ``fsid`` is a unique identifier for the cluster, 
  and stands for File System ID from the days when the Ceph Storage Cluster was 
  principally for the Ceph Filesystem. Ceph now supports native interfaces, 
  block devices, and object storage gateway interfaces too, so ``fsid`` is a 
  bit of a misnomer.

- **Cluster Name:** Ceph clusters have a cluster name, which is a simple string
  without spaces. The default cluster name is ``ceph``, but you may specify
  a different cluster name. Overriding the default cluster name is 
  especially useful when you are working with multiple clusters and you need to 
  clearly understand which cluster your are working with. 
  
  For example, when you run multiple clusters in a `federated architecture`_, 
  the cluster name (e.g., ``us-west``, ``us-east``) identifies the cluster for
  the current CLI session. **Note:** To identify the cluster name on the 
  command line interface, specify the a Ceph configuration file with the 
  cluster name (e.g., ``ceph.conf``, ``us-west.conf``, ``us-east.conf``, etc.).
  Also see CLI usage (``ceph --cluster {cluster-name}``).
  
- **Monitor Name:** Each monitor instance within a cluster has a unique name. 
  In common practice, the Ceph Monitor name is the host name (we recommend one
  Ceph Monitor per host, and no commingling of Ceph OSD Daemons with 
  Ceph Monitors). You may retrieve the short hostname with ``hostname -s``.

- **Monitor Map:** Bootstrapping the initial monitor(s) requires you to 
  generate a monitor map. The monitor map requires the ``fsid``, the cluster 
  name (or uses the default), and at least one host name and its IP address.

- **Monitor Keyring**: Monitors communicate with each other via a 
  secret key. You must generate a keyring with a monitor secret and provide 
  it when bootstrapping the initial monitor(s).
  
- **Administrator Keyring**: To use the ``ceph`` CLI tools, you must have
  a ``client.admin`` user. So you must generate the admin user and keyring,
  and you must also add the ``client.admin`` user to the monitor keyring.

The foregoing requirements do not imply the creation of a Ceph Configuration 
file. However, as a best practice, we recommend creating a Ceph configuration 
file and populating it with the ``fsid``, the ``mon initial members`` and the
``mon host`` settings.

You can get and set all of the monitor settings at runtime as well. However,
a Ceph Configuration file may contain only those settings that override the 
default values. When you add settings to a Ceph configuration file, these
settings override the default settings. Maintaining those settings in a 
Ceph configuration file makes it easier to maintain your cluster.

The procedure is as follows:


#. Log in to the initial monitor node(s)::

	ssh {hostname}

   For example:: 

	ssh node1


#. Ensure you have a directory for the Ceph configuration file. By default, 
   Ceph uses ``/etc/ceph``. When you install ``ceph``, the installer will 
   create the ``/etc/ceph`` directory automatically. ::

	ls /etc/ceph   

   **Note:** Deployment tools may remove this directory when purging a
   cluster (e.g., ``ceph-deploy purgedata {node-name}``, ``ceph-deploy purge
   {node-name}``).

#. Create a Ceph configuration file. By default, Ceph uses 
   ``ceph.conf``, where ``ceph`` reflects the cluster name. ::

	sudo vim /etc/ceph/ceph.conf


#. Generate a unique ID (i.e., ``fsid``) for your cluster. :: 

	uuidgen
	

#. Add the unique ID to your Ceph configuration file. :: 

	fsid = {UUID}

   For example:: 

	fsid = a7f64266-0894-4f1e-a635-d0aeaca0e993


#. Add the initial monitor(s) to your Ceph configuration file. :: 

	mon initial members = {hostname}[,{hostname}]

   For example:: 

	mon initial members = node1


#. Add the IP address(es) of the initial monitor(s) to your Ceph configuration 
   file and save the file. :: 

	mon host = {ip-address}[,{ip-address}]

   For example::

	mon host = 192.168.0.1

   **Note:** You may use IPv6 addresses too, but you must set ``ms bind ipv6`` 
   to ``true``. See `Network Configuration Reference`_ for details about 
   network configuration.

#. Create a keyring for your cluster and generate a monitor secret key. ::

	ceph-authtool --create-keyring /tmp/ceph.mon.keyring --gen-key -n mon. --cap mon 'allow *'


#. Generate an administrator keyring, generate a ``client.admin`` user and add
   the user to the keyring. :: 

	ceph-authtool --create-keyring /etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring --gen-key -n client.admin --set-uid=0 --cap mon 'allow *' --cap osd 'allow *' --cap mds 'allow'


#. Add the ``client.admin`` key to the ``ceph.mon.keyring``. :: 

	ceph-authtool /tmp/ceph.mon.keyring --import-keyring /etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring


#. Generate a monitor map using the hostname(s), host IP address(es) and the FSID. 
   Save it as ``/tmp/monmap``:: 

	monmaptool --create --add {hostname} {ip-address} --fsid {uuid} /tmp/monmap

   For example::

	monmaptool --create --add node1 192.168.0.1 --fsid a7f64266-0894-4f1e-a635-d0aeaca0e993 /tmp/monmap


#. Create a default data directory (or directories) on the monitor host(s). ::

	sudo mkdir /var/lib/ceph/mon/{cluster-name}-{hostname}

   For example::

	sudo mkdir /var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph-node1

   See `Monitor Config Reference - Data`_ for details.

#. Populate the monitor daemon(s) with the monitor map and keyring. ::

	ceph-mon [--cluster {cluster-name}] --mkfs -i {hostname} --monmap /tmp/monmap --keyring /tmp/ceph.mon.keyring

   For example::

	ceph-mon --mkfs -i node1 --monmap /tmp/monmap --keyring /tmp/ceph.mon.keyring


#. Consider settings for a Ceph configuration file. Common settings include 
   the following::

	[global]
	fsid = {cluster-id}
	mon initial members = {hostname}[, {hostname}]
	mon host = {ip-address}[, {ip-address}]
	public network = {network}[, {network}]
	cluster network = {network}[, {network}]
	auth cluster required = cephx
	auth service required = cephx
	auth client required = cephx
	osd journal size = {n}
	osd pool default size = {n}  # Write an object n times.
	osd pool default min size = {n} # Allow writing n copy in a degraded state.
	osd pool default pg num = {n}
	osd pool default pgp num = {n}	
	osd crush chooseleaf type = {n}

   In the foregoing example, the ``[global]`` section of the configuration might
   look like this::

	[global]
	fsid = a7f64266-0894-4f1e-a635-d0aeaca0e993
	mon initial members = node1
	mon host = 192.168.0.1
	public network = 192.168.0.0/24
	auth cluster required = cephx
	auth service required = cephx
	auth client required = cephx
	osd journal size = 1024
	osd pool default size = 2
	osd pool default min size = 1
	osd pool default pg num = 333
	osd pool default pgp num = 333	
	osd crush chooseleaf type = 1

#. Touch the ``done`` file.

   Mark that the monitor is created and ready to be started::

	sudo touch /var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph-node1/done

#. Start the monitor(s).

   For Ubuntu, use Upstart::

	sudo start ceph-mon id=node1 [cluster={cluster-name}]

   In this case, to allow the start of the daemon at each reboot you
   must create two empty files like this::

	sudo touch /var/lib/ceph/mon/{cluster-name}-{hostname}/upstart

   For example::

	sudo touch /var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph-node1/upstart

   For Debian/CentOS/RHEL, use sysvinit::

	sudo /etc/init.d/ceph start mon.node1


#. Verify that Ceph created the default pools. ::

	ceph osd lspools

   You should see output like this::

	0 data,1 metadata,2 rbd,


#. Verify that the monitor is running. :: 

	ceph -s

   You should see output that the monitor you started is up and running, and
   you should see a health error indicating that placement groups are stuck
   inactive. It should look something like this:: 

	cluster a7f64266-0894-4f1e-a635-d0aeaca0e993
	  health HEALTH_ERR 192 pgs stuck inactive; 192 pgs stuck unclean; no osds
	  monmap e1: 1 mons at {node1=192.168.0.1:6789/0}, election epoch 1, quorum 0 node1
	  osdmap e1: 0 osds: 0 up, 0 in
	  pgmap v2: 192 pgs, 3 pools, 0 bytes data, 0 objects
	     0 kB used, 0 kB / 0 kB avail
	     192 creating

   **Note:** Once you add OSDs and start them, the placement group health errors
   should disappear. See the next section for details.


Adding OSDs
===========

Once you have your initial monitor(s) running, you should add OSDs. Your cluster
cannot reach an ``active + clean`` state until you have enough OSDs to handle the
number of copies of an object (e.g., ``osd pool default size = 2`` requires at
least two OSDs). After bootstrapping your monitor, your cluster has a default
CRUSH map; however, the CRUSH map doesn't have any Ceph OSD Daemons mapped to 
a Ceph Node.


Short Form
----------

Ceph provides the ``ceph-disk`` utility, which can prepare a disk, partition or
directory for use with Ceph. The ``ceph-disk`` utility creates the OSD ID by
incrementing the index. Additionally, ``ceph-disk`` will add the new OSD to the
CRUSH map under the host for you. Execute ``ceph-disk -h`` for CLI details. 
The ``ceph-disk`` utility automates the steps of the `Long Form`_ below. To
create the first two OSDs with the short form procedure, execute the following
on  ``node2`` and ``node3``:


#. Prepare the OSD. ::

	ssh {node-name}
	sudo ceph-disk prepare --cluster {cluster-name} --cluster-uuid {uuid} --fs-type {ext4|xfs|btrfs} {data-path} [{journal-path}]

   For example::

	ssh node1
	sudo ceph-disk prepare --cluster ceph --cluster-uuid a7f64266-0894-4f1e-a635-d0aeaca0e993 --fs-type ext4 /dev/hdd1


#. Activate the OSD::

	sudo ceph-disk activate {data-path} [--activate-key {path}]

   For example:: 

	sudo ceph-disk activate /dev/hdd1

   **Note:** Use the ``--activate-key`` argument if you do not have a copy
   of ``/var/lib/ceph/bootstrap-osd/{cluster}.keyring`` on the Ceph Node.


Long Form
---------

Without the benefit of any helper utilities, creating an OSD and adding it to
the cluster and CRUSH map the following procedure. To create the first two 
OSDs with the long form procedure, execute the following on ``node2`` and 
``node3``:

#. Connect to the OSD host. :: 

	ssh {node-name}

#. Generate a UUID for the OSD. ::

	uuidgen


#. Create the OSD. If no UUID is given, it will be set automatically when the 
   OSD starts up. The following command will output the OSD number, which you 
   will need for subsequent steps. ::
	
	ceph osd create [{uuid} [{id}]]


#. Create the default directory on your new OSD. :: 

	ssh {new-osd-host}
	sudo mkdir /var/lib/ceph/osd/{cluster-name}-{osd-number}
	

#. If the OSD is for a drive other than the OS drive, prepare it 
   for use with Ceph, and mount it to the directory you just created:: 

	ssh {new-osd-host}
	sudo mkfs -t {fstype} /dev/{hdd}
	sudo mount -o user_xattr /dev/{hdd} /var/lib/ceph/osd/{cluster-name}-{osd-number}

	
#. Initialize the OSD data directory. :: 

	ssh {new-osd-host}
	sudo ceph-osd -i {osd-num} --mkfs --mkkey --osd-uuid [{uuid}]
	
   The directory must be empty before you can run ``ceph-osd`` with the 
   ``--mkkey`` option. In addition, the ceph-osd tool requires specification
   of custom cluster names with the ``--cluster`` option.


#. Register the OSD authentication key. The value of ``ceph`` for 
   ``ceph-{osd-num}`` in the path is the ``$cluster-$id``.  If your 
   cluster name differs from ``ceph``, use your cluster name instead.::

	sudo ceph auth add osd.{osd-num} osd 'allow *' mon 'allow profile osd' -i /var/lib/ceph/osd/{cluster-name}-{osd-num}/keyring


#. Add your Ceph Node to the CRUSH map. ::

	ceph [--cluster {cluster-name}] osd crush add-bucket {hostname} host

   For example::

	ceph osd crush add-bucket node1 host


#. Place the Ceph Node under the root ``default``. ::

	ceph osd crush move node1 root=default


#. Add the OSD to the CRUSH map so that it can begin receiving data. You may
   also decompile the CRUSH map, add the OSD to the device list, add the host as a
   bucket (if it's not already in the CRUSH map), add the device as an item in the
   host, assign it a weight, recompile it and set it. ::

	ceph [--cluster {cluster-name}] osd crush add {id-or-name} {weight} [{bucket-type}={bucket-name} ...]

   For example::

	ceph osd crush add osd.0 1.0 host=node1


#. After you add an OSD to Ceph, the OSD is in your configuration. However, 
   it is not yet running. The OSD is ``down`` and ``in``. You must start 
   your new OSD before it can begin receiving data.

   For Ubuntu, use Upstart::

	sudo start ceph-osd id={osd-num} [cluster={cluster-name}]

   For example::

	sudo start ceph-osd id=0
	sudo start ceph-osd id=1

   For Debian/CentOS/RHEL, use sysvinit::

	sudo /etc/init.d/ceph start osd.{osd-num} [--cluster {cluster-name}]

   For example::

	sudo /etc/init.d/ceph start osd.0
	sudo /etc/init.d/ceph start osd.1

   In this case, to allow the start of the daemon at each reboot you
   must create an empty file like this::

	sudo touch /var/lib/ceph/osd/{cluster-name}-{osd-num}/sysvinit

   For example::

	sudo touch /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-0/sysvinit
	sudo touch /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-1/sysvinit

   Once you start your OSD, it is ``up`` and ``in``.




Summary
=======

Once you have your monitor and two OSDs up and running, you can watch the
placement groups peer by executing the following:: 

	ceph -w

To view the tree, execute the following:: 

	ceph osd tree
	
You should see output that looks something like this:: 

	# id	weight	type name	up/down	reweight
	-1	2	root default
	-2	2		host node1
	0	1			osd.0	up	1
	-3	1		host node2
	1	1			osd.1	up	1
