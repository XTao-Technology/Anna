Anna - A branch project from CEPH
===========================
Anna is a XTAO project branched from CEPH distributed storage.
CEPH is a nice opensource project for unified distributed storage
which is supposed to support block, file and object storage access.
Unfortuntely, there is a gap between an opensource project and a real
enterprise level storage system. Especially, File system of CEPH is
a fragile and is hard to be treated as a serious enterprise storage system.
XTAO dedicated a team and took several years to complete the filesystem and
object storage for CEPH. And XTAO invented a mechanism for CEPH to seamlessly
integrate filesystem/object store with unstructural data managment system.
