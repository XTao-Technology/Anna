 Configuring Monitor/OSD Interaction
=====================================

.. index:: heartbeat

After you have completed your initial Ceph configuration, you may deploy and run
Ceph.  When you execute a command such as ``ceph health`` or ``ceph -s``,  the
:term:`Ceph Monitor` reports on the current state of the :term:`Ceph Storage
Cluster`. The Ceph Monitor knows about the Ceph Storage Cluster by requiring
reports from each :term:`Ceph OSD Daemon`, and by receiving reports from Ceph
OSD Daemons about the status of their neighboring Ceph OSD Daemons. If the Ceph
Monitor doesn't receive reports, or if it receives reports of changes in the
Ceph Storage Cluster, the Ceph Monitor updates the status of the :term:`Ceph
Cluster Map`.

Ceph provides reasonable default settings for Ceph Monitor/Ceph OSD Daemon
interaction. However, you may override the defaults. The following sections
describe how Ceph Monitors and Ceph OSD Daemons interact for the purposes of
monitoring the Ceph Storage Cluster.

.. index:: heartbeat interval

OSDs Check Heartbeats
=====================

Each Ceph OSD Daemon checks the heartbeat of other Ceph OSD Daemons every 6
seconds. You can change the heartbeat interval by adding an ``osd heartbeat
interval`` setting under the ``[osd]`` section of your Ceph configuration file,
or by setting the value at runtime. If a neighboring Ceph OSD Daemon doesn't
show a heartbeat within a 20 second grace period, the Ceph OSD Daemon may
consider the neighboring Ceph OSD Daemon ``down`` and report it back to a Ceph
Monitor, which will update the Ceph Cluster Map. You may change this grace
period by adding an ``osd heartbeat grace`` setting under the ``[osd]`` section
of your Ceph configuration file, or by setting the value at runtime.

.. index:: OSD down report

OSDs Report Down OSDs
=====================

By default, a Ceph OSD Daemon must report to the Ceph Monitors that another Ceph
OSD Daemon is ``down`` three times before the Ceph Monitors acknowledge that the
reported Ceph OSD Daemon is ``down``.  You can change the minimum number of
``osd down`` reports by adding an ``mon osd min down reports`` setting (``osd
min down reports`` prior to v0.62) under the ``[mon]`` section of your Ceph
configuration file, or by setting the value at runtime. By default, only one
Ceph OSD Daemon is required to report another Ceph OSD Daemon ``down``. You can
change the number of Ceph OSD Daemones required to report a Ceph OSD Daemon
``down`` to a Ceph Monitor by adding an ``mon osd min down reporters`` setting
(``osd min down reporters`` prior to v0.62) under the ``[mon]`` section of your
Ceph configuration file, or by setting the value at runtime.

.. index:: peering failure

OSDs Report Peering Failure
===========================

If a Ceph OSD Daemon cannot peer with any of the Ceph OSD Daemons defined in its
Ceph configuration file (or the cluster map), it will ping a Ceph Monitor for
the most recent copy of the cluster map every 30 seconds. You can change the
Ceph Monitor heartbeat interval by adding an ``osd mon heartbeat interval``
setting under the ``[osd]`` section of your Ceph configuration file, or by
setting the value at runtime.

.. index:: OSD status

OSDs Report Their Status
========================

If an Ceph OSD Daemon doesn't report to a Ceph Monitor, the Ceph Monitor will
consider the Ceph OSD Daemon ``down`` after the  ``mon osd report timeout``
elapses. A Ceph OSD Daemon sends a report to a Ceph Monitor when a reportable
event such as a failure, a change in placement group stats, a change in
``up_thru`` or when it boots within 5 seconds. You can change the Ceph OSD
Daemon minimum report interval by adding an ``osd mon report interval min``
setting under the ``[osd]`` section of your Ceph configuration file, or by
setting the value at runtime. A Ceph OSD Daemon sends a report to a Ceph 
Monitor every 120 seconds irrespective of whether any notable changes occur. 
You can change the Ceph Monitor report interval by adding an ``osd mon report 
interval max`` setting under the ``[osd]`` section of your Ceph configuration 
file, or by setting the value at runtime.
