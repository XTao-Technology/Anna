CephFS Administrative commands
==============================

Filesystems
-----------

These commands operate on the CephFS filesystems in your Ceph cluster.
Note that by default only one filesystem is permitted: to enable
creation of multiple filesystems use ``ceph fs flag set enable_multiple true``.

::

    fs new <filesystem name> <metadata pool name> <data pool name>

::

    fs ls

::

    fs rm <filesystem name> [--yes-i-really-mean-it]

::

    fs reset <filesystem name>

::

    fs get <filesystem name>

::

    fs set <filesystem name> <var> <val>

::

    fs add_data_pool <filesystem name> <pool name/id>

::

    fs rm_data_pool <filesystem name> <pool name/id>


Daemons
-------

These commands act on specific mds daemons or ranks.  For convenience,
they accept arguments that 

::

    mds fail <gid/name/role

::

    mds deactivate <role>

::

    tell mds.<daemon name>

::

    mds metadata <gid/name/role>

::

    mds repaired <role>



Global settings
---------------

::

    fs dump

::

    fs flag set <flag name> <flag val> [<confirmation string>]

    flag name must be one of ['enable_multiple']

    some flags require you to confirm your intentions with "--yes-i-really-mean-it"
    or a similar string they will prompt you with. Consider these actions carefully
    before proceeding; they are placed on especially dangerous activities.

Advanced
--------

These commands are not required in normal operation, and exist
for use in exceptional circumstances.  Incorrect use of these
commands may cause serious problems, such as an inaccessible
filesystem.

    mds compat rm_compat

    mds compat rm_incompat

::

    mds compat show

::

    mds getmap

::

    mds set_state

::

    mds rmfailed
