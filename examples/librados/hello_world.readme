This simple librados program can be built by running "make" (and cleaned up
with "make clean"), assuming you have librados-dev already installed.

And executed using
./librados_hello_world -c ../../src/ceph.conf
(or whatever path to a ceph.conf is appropriate to you, or
by explicitly specifying monitors, user id, and keys).

It demonstrates using librados in a non-Ceph project and the code should
be self-explanatory.
