## use jemalloc instead of tcmalloc
#
# jemalloc is generally faster for small IO workloads and when
# ceph-osd is backed by SSDs.  However, memory usage is usually
# higher by 200-300mb.

## automatically restart systemd units on upgrade
#
# By default, it is left to the administrator to restart
# ceph daemons (or their related systemd units) manually
# when the 'ceph' package is upgraded. By setting this
# parameter to "yes", package upgrade will trigger a 
# "systemctl try-restart" on all the ceph systemd units
# currently active on the node.
